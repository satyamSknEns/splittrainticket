              When you travel between London and Edinburgh on the East Coast
              route, you will typically start your journey from London King's
              Cross Station, famous for its Platform 9 Â¾. Indeed you can take a
              picture next to the platform sign, and there is a shop with plenty
              of Harry Potter souvenirs. Trains from London Kings Cross to
              Edinburgh usually are high-speed, with no changes and minimal
              stops.

              Typically you can expect the train to stop in Peterborough, York,
              Durham, and Newcastle on the way; with all of these worth visiting
              if you wish to stop en route, York is particularly worth a visit
              with its National Railway Museum. If you want to reach Edinburgh
              particularly quickly, take a Lumo train that only stops twice
              before reaching Edinburgh. Once you reach Newcastle, your route
              will hug the coast to Edinburgh; it's worth sitting on the right
              side of the train to see it.
